Unofficial complete rewrite of Industrial Craft 2 Charging Bench using the IC2 API
(http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=929)

Adds the brand new Charging Bench, an electric machine with 12 charging slots for all your tools, batteries,
and anything else you can stuff in the top slot of a batbox. Comes in three varieties, one for each tier.
It's even smart enough to unstack batteries if you place them into it stacked! Plus, if it's redstone powered,
it'll reverse operation and discharge batteries to emit power instead.
